# Unofficial JBoss/WildFly Docker Images

Official Docker images for JBoss projects are at https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/.

## How to use it ?

This image is not published in any repository and so have to be built explicitly.

. Configure boot2docker as explained in http://blog.arungupta.me/2014/07/getting-started-with-docker/
. Clone this workspace: `git clone https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-images.git`
. For a WildFly image on CentOS, change to `wildfly-centos' directory. For a WildFly image on Ubuntu, change to `wildfly-ubutu' directory.
. Build the image as `docker build -t wildfly .`
